This project analyzes **Return on Investment (ROI)** for Airbnb vacation rentals in **Queenstown** and **Christchurch**, New Zealand, using data from the AirROI API. Covering August 2024‚ÄìJuly 2025, it compares key metrics‚Äîactive listings, occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADR), revenue, and revenue-to-median house price ratio‚Äîto guide property investment decisions. Visualizations highlight Queenstown‚Äôs tourism-driven peaks and Christchurch‚Äôs stable urban market.

## üìã Project Overview

This Jupyter notebook (`airroi_nz_simple_optimized.ipynb`) uses the AirROI API to fetch and analyze Airbnb market data for Queenstown (Otago) and Christchurch (Canterbury). Key objectives include:
- Comparing market performance (active listings, occupancy, ADR, revenue) over 12 months.
- Assessing ROI via revenue-to-median house price ratios (Queenstown: NZD 1.85M, Christchurch: NZD 0.7M).
- Visualizing trends to highlight seasonal and regional differences.

**Data Source**: AirROI API ([documentation](https://www.airroi.com/api/documentation/#tag/Listings)), stored in `nz_airbnb_all_metrics.csv`.

**Tools**: Python, pandas, matplotlib, requests.

## üéØ Key Findings

- **Queenstown**:
  - Peaks in summer (Dec‚ÄìFeb, e.g., NZD 13,392 revenue, 68% occupancy in January 2025) and winter (e.g., NZD 11,976 revenue in August 2024).
  - Revenue-to-price ratio (~0.0072 in January 2025) and high ADR (NZD 648.2) reflect strong ROI potential for short-term rentals.
  - 200‚Äì300 more active listings than Christchurch (e.g., 2,613 vs. 2,466 in January 2025).
- **Christchurch**:
  - Stable metrics (e.g., NZD 4,129 revenue, 60% occupancy, NZD 222.9 ADR in January 2025).
  - Lower revenue-to-price ratio (~0.0059) but consistent returns, ideal for long-term rentals.
- **Investment Insights**:
  - Queenstown suits high-yield, seasonal rentals but requires significant investment (NZD 1.85M).
  - Christchurch offers steady, lower-risk income (NZD 0.7M median price).
